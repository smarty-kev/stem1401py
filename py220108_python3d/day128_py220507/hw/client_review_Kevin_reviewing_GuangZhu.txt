Client review
Client : Kevin
Program from : Guang Zhu


My first issue : Everything is too crammed, would be better to have added spacing/padding between lines

From the little testing that I have done, the values (perimeter, area, volume) seem to be accurate
The coloring function seems to not be complete, not many coloring options, and I am not sure not which shape I have colored

The UI is simple to understand and easy to use. Program is responsive and quick. Well done!

My decision:
Accept
