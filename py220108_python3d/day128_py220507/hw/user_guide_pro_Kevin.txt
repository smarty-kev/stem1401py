This is a guide for The Plotter application

How to start program :
1. - Open Folder location on PC
2. - Run "client_app.py" in IDE or using the "python client_app.py in Terminal"

How to use program :

When run, you will be greeted with a main menu
If you wish to plot a shape, input "1"
If you wish to color a shape that you plotted, input "2", only if you have already plotted a shape
Otherwise, input "x" to exit the program


==================


After inputting "1", you will enter a sub-menu to plot shapes.
2D Shapes available : Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle, Right Triangle, Oval, Parallelogram, Rhombus
3D Shapes available : Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Pyramid
Press the number corresponding to the desired shape to plot.
After that, you will have to input the parameters for said shape
(i.e. : A square requires only one parameter, "a", whilst a rectangle requires two, "a" and "b")
The program will plot the shape, print out the perimeter and area (2D) or the area and volume (3D)

You will be sent back to the sub-menu, where you could perform more shape plotting.
If you wish to return to the main menu, enter "x".
You may exit the program by entering "x" twice or by simply stopping the program by brute force (through IDE or Terminal) - not recommended


==================


After inputting "2", you will enter a sub-menu to choose which shape to color
A list of all plotted shapes will appear.
Enter the number corresponding to the desired shape to color.

After, you will enter another sub-menu to choose the coloring format
Enter "1" for default colors
Enter "2" for hex colors
If you wish to cancel and return to main menu, enter "x"

If you chose 1, you will be greeted with 8 colors to chose from (i.e. : "1" for red, "2" for green...)
If you chose 2, you will be able to enter your own custom hex value color
The program will color the desired shape with the selected color

You will then be sent back to the Coloring Menu, where you can color more shapes.
You can return to the main menu to plot shapes by entering "x"


==================



Enjoy and have fun!
