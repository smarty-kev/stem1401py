This is a guide for The Plotter application

How to start program :
1. - Open Folder location on PC
2. - Run "client_app.py" in IDE or using the "python client_app.py in Terminal"

How to use program :

When run, you will be greeted with a main menu
If you wish to plot a shape, input "1"
Otherwise, input "exit" to exit the program

After inputting "1", you will enter a sub-menu to plot shapes.
2D Shapes available : Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle
3D Shapes available : Cube, Sphere
Press the number corresponding to the desired shape to plot.
After that, you will have to input the parameters for said shape
(i.e. : A square requires only one parameter, "a", whilst a rectangle requires two, "a" and "b")
The program will plot the shape, print out the perimeter and area (2D) or the area and volume (3D)

You will be sent back to the sub-menu, where you could perform more shape plotting.
You may exit the program by entering "exit" twice or by simply stopping the program by brute force (through IDE or Terminal) - not recommended

Enjoy and have fun!
