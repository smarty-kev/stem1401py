How to define a class:

class Dog:
    # class attributes
    c_v1 = 0

    def __init__(self, v1, v2):
        # instance attributes
        self.v1 = v1
        self.v2 = v2

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        pass

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        pass

    def instance_methods(self):
        pass
