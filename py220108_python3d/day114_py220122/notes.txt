INHERITANCE IN Object-Oriented


- creating new class using details of an existing class without modifying it


single level inheritance
ex:
Class A and Class B
Class B inherits all the properties and methods of Class A

class A = parent class, superclass, base class
class B = child class, subclass, derived class

ex:
Animal = ClassA
Dog    = ClassB


multi-level inheritance
class A <- class B <- class C
ex:
class GrandParent:
    pass
class Parent(GrandParent):
    pass
class Child(Parent):
    pass
